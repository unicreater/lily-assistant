# Email Drafting

When helping draft emails:

1. **Gather Info** (if not provided):
   - Who is the recipient?
   - What is the purpose/main message?
   - What tone is appropriate? (formal, casual, friendly-professional)

2. **Structure**:
   - Clear subject line
   - Appropriate greeting
   - Concise body (get to the point quickly)
   - Clear call-to-action if needed
   - Professional sign-off

3. **Tone Guidelines**:
   - **Formal** (executives, external clients): "Dear [Name]", full sentences, "Best regards"
   - **Professional** (colleagues, vendors): "Hi [Name]", direct but friendly, "Thanks"
   - **Casual** (close colleagues, friends): "Hey [Name]", conversational, "Cheers"
