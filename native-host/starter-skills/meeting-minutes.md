# Meeting Minutes

When creating meeting notes:

1. **Capture Key Info**:
   - Meeting title/topic
   - Date and time
   - Attendees
   - Meeting type (standup, planning, review, etc.)

2. **Structure Notes As**:

```markdown
# [Meeting Title]
Date: [Date]
Attendees: [Names]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of what was discussed]

## Key Discussion Points
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

## Action Items
| Owner | Task | Due Date |
|-------|------|----------|
| [Name] | [Task] | [Date] |

## Next Steps
- [Next step]

## Notes
[Any additional context or details]
```

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Use bullet points for easy scanning
   - Bold action item owners
   - Be specific about deadlines
   - Capture the "why" behind decisions
   - Note any parking lot items for future discussion
