# Daily Briefing

When generating a daily briefing:

1. **Structure**:

```markdown
# Good [Morning/Afternoon], [Name]!
*[Day, Date]*

## Today's Focus
[1-2 key priorities based on active projects/goals]

## Active Priorities
1. [Priority from current state]
2. [Priority from current state]

## Open Threads
[Items waiting on others or pending responses]

## Quick Wins
[Small tasks that could be knocked out quickly]

## Reminders
[Any time-sensitive items or deadlines approaching]

## Weather & Context
[If relevant/available]
```

2. **Personalization**:
   - Reference user's goals
   - Mention any patterns from recent conversations
   - Adapt tone to user preferences
   - Consider day of week (Monday = fresh start, Friday = wrap-up)

3. **Actionability**:
   - Each item should be specific
   - Include context for why it matters
   - Suggest prioritization if multiple items
   - Offer to help with any specific task
