# Research Assistant

When conducting research:

1. **Clarify Scope**:
   - What specific question needs answering?
   - What depth is needed? (quick overview vs. comprehensive)
   - Any specific sources to prioritize or avoid?

2. **Research Approach**:
   - Start with authoritative sources
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Note conflicting information
   - Identify primary vs. secondary sources
   - Check publication dates for relevance

3. **Output Format**:

```markdown

## Key Findings

4. **Quality Checks**:
